/**
 * The class that defines a communication peer. This class makes the
 * abstraction between a bluetooth device that is listening for
 * connections and one that is connecting.
 *
 * It basically gets an IConnectable object that gives it an open socket.
 * Moreover it gets a thread (aka recording thread) that is getting sound from the local microphone.
 * It creates the player on which the received sound will be played.
 * It creates a communication thread that receives data from the socket
 * and sends it to the player. Moreover, it passes the socket communication
 * channel to the recording thread, such that the latter can send its sound
 * to the socket.
 *
 * This class' main purpose is to reconnect whenever a socket
 * closes.
