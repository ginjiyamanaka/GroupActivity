Motolky

Bluetooth Intercom App for Android

This application offers free voice communication over Bluetooth in a small
group of Android users.

This application was specially designed for noisy environments, such as
motorcycle or bicycle rider groups, construction work teams or any other
context when two or more people, in close vicinity of each other, want
to communicate, but can't do it directly.

IMPORTANT
=========

Unfortunately, the code that was interfacing the Java code with the
Speex library (developed in C) has been lost. Therefore, some work needs to
be done in order to redevelop that thin layer of code.

TODO
====

Bellow are some features that are worth implementing:

1. Some people requested the following feature. They have one Android phone
and multiple bluetooth headsets and they want to make the bluetooth headsets
talk in a group by having the Android phone as a central point that connects
them all.

2. Porting Motolky to other mobile platforms (Windows Phone 7, Blackberry, etc).

3. Introducing support for WiFi.
